# CoCoS-KnowledgeBase

CoCoS, short for Communication and Control Server, started small, but grew larger and larger, not always in the best interest of usability, but always focussing on applying functionalities that are suitable for systems and/or customers. Our focus is on the self-reliance of the user, enabling them to modify configurations in CoCoS at any time of the day, anywhere in the world. Cocos-knowledgebase repository is setup to create an online CoCoS knowledge base for all CoCoS users. Whenever we're asked a question, support an fixable issue or are asked for an example or configurations/setup support, we will, from now on, document them. 

The knowledgebase is setup as an article based system, hoping Google or any other search engine will index them so you can find any information you'll ever need when using CoCoS. 

Please feel free to ask us anything at support@cocos.software.
